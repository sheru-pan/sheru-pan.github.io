# 👋 Hello, I’m Himangshu Pan

## 🛡️ **Offensive Security Researcher** 🐍 \| **Python Developer**

---

Welcome to my personal space on the internet.

I’m an aspiring **offensive security researcher** with a background in Python development and backend engineering. My journey began by solving real-world problems through automation and backend services, and has now evolved into a focused path toward understanding how systems break—and how to secure them.

I'm currently immersing myself in ethical hacking, exploit development, reconnaissance automation, and secure system design. My curiosity for how things work (and how they fail) drives me to explore both offensive and defensive security with a builder’s mindset.

## 🔭 Current Mission

Right now, I’m learning everything I can about **offensive security**—from OSINT and recon to fuzzing, privilege escalation, and bypass techniques. I spend most of my time in the terminal, breaking things in labs, building custom tools in Python, and studying vulnerabilities in real-world systems.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to a safer digital world by understanding the attacker’s perspective and applying that knowledge to secure software, systems, and infrastructure.
