## ⛓️ 2019–2024: Blockchain & Backend Focus

Though I earned my CEH in 2018, I couldn’t shift into InfoSec due to practical limitations. I continued to grow as a developer.

- Joined **Klizo Solutions Pvt. Ltd.** in 2019, where I was introduced to **blockchain technologies** like **Hyperledger Indy** and **Aries**, building decentralized identity solutions.
- After 2021, I began freelancing:
  - Created and deployed **Secret Invoice** on the **Secret Network**
  - Contributed to **Emprops**, an NFT + AI platform, focusing on backend logic and test coverage
- These experiences deepened my knowledge of secure system design, even while working outside formal cybersecurity roles.

## 🔁 2025 Onwards: Back to Security

In **Q2 of 2025**, I made a **deliberate return to the field of cybersecurity**, this time with focused intent and technical maturity.

I’m currently diving deep into:

- **Offensive security techniques** — privilege escalation, enumeration, exploitation
- **Recon automation tools** using Python
- **Vulnerability research**, basic binary analysis, and system hardening
- Practicing through labs, write-ups, and CTFs

My long-term goal is to become a **skilled offensive security researcher**—someone who understands systems deeply and helps secure them by thinking like an attacker.
